# BIOS Update Z420

#The BIOS version the device should be on
Version == 3.94

#Command to be executed for the BIOS update


## NOTE: At least BIOS 3.91 is bundled with HPQFlash 4.40 which can *NOT* read 
## newer password files create with HpqPswd.exe. This results in the BIOS update to fail.
##
## Please download ProDesk 600 G1 BIOS 2.72 (or newer) which includes HPQFlash 4.50 
## from https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp84001-84500/sp84334.exe
##
## Extract this softpaq by running SP84334.exe -e -s, then copy only C:\SWSetup\SP84334\HPqFlash.exe 
## and \HPQFlash.txt to the folder \HPQFlash here, overwriting the existing files. After that, 
## the BIOS update will work.
